# A-Heuristic-Neural-Network-Relying-on-Fuzzy-Logic-for-Scoring
Using fuzzy logic to modify the fully connected layer, accompanying with auxiliary output layers, to provide neural networks inherent knowledge.

# this algorithm can decompose fused features, with which categaries can hardly be identified.
